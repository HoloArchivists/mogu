{{ linkable_header("Using the Search Engine", "using-search") }}
<div>
	Search results can be filtered by category, remake, trusted, and users.
	The results can be further sorted by size, date, seeders, leechers, completed count, and comment count.
</div>
<div>
	You can combine search terms with the <kbd>|</kbd> operator, such as
	<kbd>foo|bar</kbd>, to match any of the words instead all of them.
</div>
<div>
	To exclude results matching a certain word, prefix them with <kbd>-</kbd>,
	e.g. <kbd>foo -bar</kbd>, which will return torrents with <em>foo</em> in the
	name, but not those which have <em>bar</em> in the name as well.
</div>
<div>
	If you want to search for a several-word expression (substring) in its entirety, you can
	surround searches with <kbd>"</kbd> (double quotes), such as
	<kbd>"foo bar"</kbd>, which would match torrents named <em>foo bar</em> but not
	those named <em>bar foo</em>. You may also use the aforementioned <kbd>|</kbd> to group
	phrases together: <kbd>"foo bar"|"foo baz"</kbd>. You can negate the entire
	group with <kbd>-</kbd> (e.g. <kbd>-"foo bar"|"foo baz"</kbd>), but not single items.
</div>
<div>
	You can also use <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd> to signify precedence, but quoted strings do
	not honor this. Using <kbd>(hello world) "foo bar"</kbd> is fine, but quoted strings inside
	the parentheses will lead to unexpected results.
</div>

{{ linkable_header("Reporting Torrents", "reporting") }}
<div>
	If you find a torrent that breaks the rules, click the
	<button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-danger">Report</button> button to the right
	of the torrent's information page. Then, enter a reason for your report in the
	dialog that opens, and hit the <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-danger">
	Report</button> button to confirm.
</div>

{{ linkable_header("Styling Descriptions and Comments", "styling") }}
<div>
	You can style your comments and your torrent's description using
	<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown</a>.
	This includes adding images or linking to external websites.
</div>
<div>
	To link to an external site, use <kbd>[label](https://example.com)</kbd>
	where the text in the <kbd>[]</kbd> square brackets is the shown text of your
	link, and the URL in the <kbd>()</kbd> parentheses is the URL your link will
	point to.
</div>
<div>
	Embedding an image is similar. Use <kbd>![alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)</kbd>
	to have an image embedded in your comment or description. Note the <kbd>!</kbd>
	exclamation mark at the beginning, denoting that this link is an image.
</div>
